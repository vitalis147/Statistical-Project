Project Case Scenario
Project Scenario: You are a data scientist with a housing agency in Boston, MA. You have been given access to a previous dataset on housing prices derived from the U.S. Census Service to present insights to higher management. Based on your experience in statistics, what information can you provide them to help with making an informed decision? Upper management would like to get some insight into the following:

* Is there a significant difference in the median value of houses bounded by the Charles River or not?
* Is there a difference in the median values of houses for each proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940?
* Can we conclude that there is no relationship between nitric oxide concentrations and the proportion of non-retail business acres per town?
* What is the impact of an additional weighted distance to the five Boston employment centers on the median value of owner-occupied homes?

Using the appropriate graphs and charts, generate basic statistics and visualizations that you think will be useful for the upper management to give them important insight given the question they are asking. In your graphs, include an explanation of each statistic.

The following describes the dataset variables:
· CRIM: per capita crime rate by town
· ZN: the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq. ft.
· INDUS: the proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
· CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
· NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
· RM: average number of rooms per dwelling
· AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
· DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centers
· RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways
· TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
· PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town
· LSTAT: % lower status of the population
· MEDV: Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's

A statistical analysis of house prices in Boston, MA A dataset provided by IBM for the final project in a course: **Statistics for Data Science with Python** which is available
on Coursera. It was done with the use of popular Python libraries such as pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computation, matplotlib.pyplot, and seaborn 
for visualization, scipy.stats for statistical computing, and statsmodels.api for regression modeling.
